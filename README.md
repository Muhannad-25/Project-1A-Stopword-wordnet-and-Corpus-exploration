## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary

This project investigates the linguistic role of stopwords across several corpora and languages.  
Although stopwords are commonly removed due to their limited semantic value, this work
shows that their frequency, syntactic role, and contextual behavior may provide deeper insights
into language structure.

Ten specifications were implemented, including frequency analysis, PoS and WordNet coverage,
semantic similarity using FastText, multilingual comparison, alternative statistical measures,
co-occurrence, and sentiment-based exploration.

All evidence and outputs are included in the final report and the `artifacts/` directory.
